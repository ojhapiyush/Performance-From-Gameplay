# Data Science Project: Predicting Student Performance from gameplay

## 1. Data Loading using Pandas Library

Loaded the data using the pandas library to create a DataFrame.

## 2. Memory Optimization

As the data was bulky (4+ GB), optimized memory usage to reduce the memory footprint and improve processing efficiency.

## 3. Data Manipulation

To ensure data quality, removed null values and duplicated entries from the dataset.

## 4. Feature Engineering

As the original data was not suitable for model training, erformed feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

## 5. Basic Exploration of Prepared Dataset

Conducted basic exploration of the prepared dataset to gain insights and understand the data better. This included examining summary statistics, visualizing data, and analyzing correlations.

## 6. Splitting Test and Train Data Sets

To evaluate the model's performance, split the dataset into separate train and test sets. This allowed to train the model on the train set and assess its performance on the unseen test set.

## 7. Training the Model for 18 Different Questions

Trained the model for all 18 different questions using gradient boosting classifier and random forest classifier.

## 8. Model Comparison based on Accuracy

Compared the accuracy of the gradient boosting classifier and random forest classifier to evaluate their performance on the dataset.

This documentation summarizes the key steps followed to predict student performance.
